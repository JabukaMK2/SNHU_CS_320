**Software Testing and Automation**

_How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?_

It is important that I maintain and build functional and secure code by ensuring testing is part of everything I create.  Unit testing is an effective way to test small parts of code, ensuring that they act as you expect they would.  The later in the project it gets, the more expensive and difficult it becomes to fix it so I will endevor to create code without any intentional error.  Security is the same in this way, as security has to be part of everything you do from the first line of code, to the last.

_How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?_

User needs can be translated into user stories, or what a user expects to happen as a result of their input and situation.  These stories can then be boiled down into use cases, and then functionality requirements.  By making tests work around functionality, we can ensure that the code will properly refelct the needs of the user.

_How do I approach designing software?_

I approach it as part of something bigger.  Code has to be clean and efficient, it has to be tested and pass functionality tests.  Making software is a team effort, and its important to remember that and use your peers as resources against error and bias.
